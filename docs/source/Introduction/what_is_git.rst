What is git ?
++++++++++++++++++

It's a **version control system**. It is a software that tracks and 
manages changes to files over time. Updates, changes to files, 
make new files, work in the same project with others. Git helps 
us to manage our projects. We can track changes, compare 
different versions of our project, go back to an older 
version (revert changes). Collaborate with others, share 
changes and combine them.

Git, like videogames lets you make checkpoints so even if you messed all up you 
will respawn back in on of the chekcpoints. You can make
"checkpoints" of your projects so even if something goes haywire up you
can still find salvation in a git checkpoint.
