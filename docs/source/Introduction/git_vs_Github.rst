Github (Git - hub) hosts Git repositories (which can be projects) 
in the cloud and make it possible and easier to colaborative with 
other people. It is a **web service** and you also need an account.

.. note:: 
    This doen't mean they aren't connected. Github is a hosting platform 
    that can store our local git repositories in the cloud. This is very
    important and crucial when collaborating with other in the same project.
